________________________________________________________________________________

                                Little tool to send custom HTTP requests 
                                and receive responses.

                                This is early draft.
                                Did not get inspired for more original name yet.

        Oh. Requester also automatically
        checks which port used for http,
        ip address of URL ond other domains
        corresponding to that ip.
