# Requester

_Little tool to send custom HTTP requests and receive responses_

   This is early draft.
   Did not get inspired for more original name yet.


- Write config.json
- Fill in custom:
  - Method
  - Path
  - Protocol
  - Host
  - Headers
  - Body
- Send to server.
- See how it goes :)


    _Oh. Requester also automatically
    checks which port used for http,
    ip address of URL ond other domains
    corresponding to that ip._
